## If I had more time...

*   I would implement more advanced features like searching and filtering the superhero list.
*   I would explore using a state management library like Redux or Context API for better management of the application's state.
*   I would create end-to-end tests to ensure the frontend and backend work together correctly.
*   I would implement more sophisticated UI elements for data input and display, potentially using a dedicated UI library.
